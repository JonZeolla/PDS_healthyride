## Ideas
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
    * Plot a histogram, scatter plot, etc.
    * General trend analysis (regression, etc.)
    * Establish seasonality trends (Holidays, weekdays, weekends, season, etc.)
    * Summary statistics (mean, median, mode, quartiles, spread, shape, etc.)
1. Feature Engineering
    * Find and describe groups of bicycle use
        * Leisure, transportation, etc. (using clustering)
    * Enrich
        * Use the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/) to retrieve a baseline trip duration based on the starting and ending locations.
        * Use the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get [historical](https://openweathermap.org/history) weather information.
