# Original Event
On 2017-09-06 the Pittsburgh Data Science meetup held a ["Hands on Python"](https://www.meetup.com/PGH-Data-Science/events/242535873/) event that took a look at the [Healthy Ride Pittsburgh](https://healthyridepgh.com/data/) dataset.

The tutorial that kicked this off has been added as a submodule of this repo.  If you'd like to pull it in, you can simply add `--recursive` to your `git clone` of this repository.

## Event Details
Summer and vacations are over, so kicking off our monthly meetup.  There was interest on working with Geo Data & Python.  I'm lining up the experts and the data sets, but this will be a hands on meeting.  Bring your laptop with your Python environment installed.

**PreReqs:**  
 * Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (or whatever Python environment you prefer)  
 * Install [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install.html)  
 * Install the following packages: (Pandas, NumPy, ski-kit learn, IPython, matplotlib, PIL, graphviz, jupyter)  

**Data Set:**  
We'll be working with Healthy Ride Pittsburgh dataset https://healthyridepgh.com/data/ 

**Agenda:**  
4:00 - 4:20: Make sure everyone's environment is set up, dataset downloaded, some basic code  
4:20 - 5:00: Walkthrough working with data, visualizing in Python with scatter plots, histograms, etc.  
5:00 - 6:00: Split into teams to start working with the data to do some cool stuff  

Hopefully the work will continue after the meeting and the teams can present on what they were able to do at the November meetup.
